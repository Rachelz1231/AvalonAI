=============================================


Step 1: Select the initial 3 players for the team.

=== INITIAL TEAM SELECTION ===

Select three agents for the initial team (e.g., 'A B C' or 'AgentA AgentB AgentC'):
You've selected: AgentA, AgentC, AgentD
Is this correct? (y/n)
Initial team: AgentA, AgentC, AgentD

Step 2: Now everyone speaks once about the initial team.

Your turn to speak. What do you want to say about the initial team?

=== AGENT RESPONSES ===
AgentA: I do have a good feeling about AgentA, however, I have reservations about AgentC and AgentD. Let's reconsider this team selection, shall we?
---
AgentB: I have a certain level of trust towards AgentA, however, AgentC and AgentD raises some suspicions. Considering the importance of the mission, we need to be sure about everyone involved in the team. I advise a careful team selection before proceeding.
---
AgentC: I agree with both of you. I sense good intentions from AgentA, but AgentC and AgentD are questionable. We should definitely reassess this team before we proceed with the mission. Let's assemble a team with players we trust fully.
---
AgentD: I concur with your assessments. AgentA seems reliable, though I hold reservations about AgentC and AgentD. It's crucial to ensure the integrity of the team. Would it perhaps be prudent to reconsider this selection and put forth nominations for a team we can all have confidence in? It's vital we approach cautiously for the mission's success.
---
AgentE: I too share the sentiments expressed. AgentA, I believe, can be entrusted but, I am unsure of AgentC and AgentD. I consider AgentB a candidate worthy of consideration. The success of the mission hinges on the reliability of the team members. Therefore, a revision of the team selection seems necessary. Let's ensure we are placing our trust in the right team members.
