=============================================


Step 1: Select the initial 3 players for the team.

=== INITIAL TEAM SELECTION ===

Select three agents for the initial team (e.g., 'A B C' or 'AgentA AgentB AgentC'):
You've selected: AgentA, AgentC, AgentD
Is this correct? (y/n)
Initial team: AgentA, AgentC, AgentD

Step 2: Now everyone speaks once about the initial team.

Your turn to speak. What do you want to say about the initial team?

=== AGENT RESPONSES ===
AgentA: I think it would be wise to consider adding AgentB into the mix as well. Their contributions to the team may prove valuable.
---
AgentB: You: I suppose it's too soon to make any definitive decisions on trustworthiness since we've yet to embark on any quests. However, I'd also support including AgentB on the team as suggested by AgentA. I think their skills would serve us well. Let's remember to stay vigilant and alert to any signs of untrustworthy behaviors from any team member.
---
AgentC: I believe that it's difficult to gauge the trustworthiness of the proposed team at this early stage in the game. However, since we haven't embarked on any quests yet, I feel we should give the selected members, AgentA, AgentC, and AgentD, an opportunity. We should then focus keenly on their actions in the quest as it will provide us valuable insights to ascertain their loyalties. Additionally, we should also consider the suggestion of including AgentB into the team for subsequent considerations.
---
AgentD: You: I concur with some points made by AgentC regarding testing loyalties for evaluating the proposed team. AgentA's suggestion to include AgentB has also been noted. However, let's remember that trust needs to be earned. Agents, your actions in the forthcoming quests will speak louder than words. I am observing everyone closely.
---
AgentE: It's quite crucial we make the right choices from the start. The team we propose could, indeed, shape the progression of our quests. AgentA, AgentC, and AgentD are all respectable and reliable as far as I know. Dedicated, honest, and I see the value they could potentially bring. That being said, everyone needs to maintain vigilance - deeds will reveal loyalties. Quality actions will be the absolute testament to true allegiance and motive. Let's keep a watchful eye on the proceedings.

Step 3: After hearing everyone's opinion, select the final 3 players for the quest.
